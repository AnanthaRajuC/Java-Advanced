**Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI)** defines a powerful set of complementary services that help improve the structure 
of application code.

The most fundamental services provided by CDI are as follows:

* Contexts: The ability to bind the lifecycle and interactions of stateful components to 
well-defined but extensible lifecycle contexts
* Dependency injection: The ability to inject components into an application in a typesafe way, 
including the ability to choose at deployment time which implementation of a particular interface to inject
